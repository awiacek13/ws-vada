# Windsurf Rules for This Project

Hi! This file explains what this project is, what tech it uses, and how to run it. It‚Äôs written for a smart STEM‚Äëtalented 12‚Äëyear‚Äëold who is just starting their programming journey. You‚Äôve got this!

## Project Purpose (What are we building?)
We‚Äôre building a friendly, modern website for a custom T‚Äëshirt shop called "VADA". There are two parts right now:

- Root website (simple):
  - Files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`
  - Purpose: A beautiful landing page with moving clouds, a hero section, featured products, and a fake cart counter.
  - Good for learning HTML (structure), CSS (design), and JavaScript (interactivity).

- React app (more advanced):
  - Folder: `vada-tshirt-shop/`
  - Files: `src/App.jsx`, `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.css`, plus a `README.md`
  - Purpose: A more powerful version using React (a JavaScript library for building interactive UIs). It makes it easier to grow the site in the future.

The project will grow over time. We‚Äôll start simple and add features step by step.

## Technologies (What tools are used?)
- HTML5 ‚Äî the skeleton of the page (tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, etc.).
- CSS3 ‚Äî the style and animations (colors, fonts, clouds, layout).
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS) ‚Äî small behaviors like smooth scrolling and updating the cart counter.
- React 18 (inside `vada-tshirt-shop/`) ‚Äî builds UI with components (reusable pieces), great for bigger apps.
- Vite (inside `vada-tshirt-shop/`) ‚Äî a fast dev server and build tool for React apps.

## How to Run (Step‚Äëby‚Äëstep)
You have two ways to view the site. Pick one or try both.

1) Run the simple root website (no installs needed)
- Option A: Double‚Äëclick `index.html` to open it in your browser. Done!
- Option B (better dev experience): Use a live server (for example, the VS Code "Live Server" extension) so changes reload instantly.

2) Run the React app (needs Node and npm)
- Install Node.js (version 18 or newer is recommended) from https://nodejs.org
- Open a terminal in the `vada-tshirt-shop/` folder
- Run:
  - `npm install`  ‚Äî downloads dependencies
  - `npm run dev`  ‚Äî starts the dev server
- Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

Tip: If something doesn‚Äôt work, read the messages in the terminal carefully; they often tell you what to fix.

## Project Structure (What‚Äôs where?)
- `/index.html` ‚Äî main HTML page for the simple site
- `/styles.css` ‚Äî styles (colors, layout, cloud animation)
- `/script.js` ‚Äî interactivity (smooth scrolling, cart counter, small UI effects)
- `/vada-tshirt-shop/` ‚Äî React project
  - `/src/App.jsx` ‚Äî main React component (the page layout)
  - `/src/main.jsx` ‚Äî React entry point (connects React to the page)
  - `/src/App.css` ‚Äî styles for the React app
  - `/README.md` ‚Äî instructions for the React app

## How Things Work (In simple terms)
- HTML puts blocks on the page (like LEGO bricks).
- CSS paints and arranges the blocks (colors, sizes, animations).
- JavaScript makes things move or react when you click or scroll.
- React lets you build with components ‚Äî small pieces (like a product card) that you can reuse and combine.

## Coding Tips for You
- Keep names clear: `addToCart`, `product-card`, `header`, etc.
- Make small changes often; test in the browser.
- Use comments to explain ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù not only ‚Äúwhat‚Äù.
- Learn by tweaking values (like colors or animation times) and see what changes.
- Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt understand everything at once ‚Äî learning code is like learning a new superpower.

## How We Can Grow This Project
- Real product data: load from a JSON file or a small API.
- Real cart: store items, quantities, and a total price.
- Product page: show details, images, and sizes.
- Customizer: upload an image or pick colors, then preview on the shirt.
- Deploy online: publish with Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages so friends can see it.

## Windows Setup Notes (Helpful reminders)
- If you install Node.js, close and re‚Äëopen your terminal after installation.
- If `npm run dev` fails, try `npm install` again and check your internet connection.
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) for best results.

## Mini Glossary
- Dependency: a package of code your project uses (installed by `npm install`).
- Dev server: a program that serves your site locally and reloads on changes.
- Component: a reusable building block in React (like a product card).
- Repository (repo): the folder of your project that can be tracked by Git.

## For Future AI Helpers (Guidance for assistants)
- Keep explanations short, friendly, and correct. Prefer examples and tiny steps.
- When suggesting changes, point to exact files and lines when possible.
- Favor simple, readable code over clever tricks.
- Offer ‚Äúwhy it works‚Äù explanations, not just code dumps.
- Provide safe copy‚Äëpaste snippets and mention where to put them.

Have fun building! Each line of code you write is another level up. üöÄ
