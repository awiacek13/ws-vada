# Windsurf Rules for This Project

Hi! This file explains our project in a simple, friendly way for a smart 12‑year‑old. Think of this like your mission map in a game: clear quests, short tips, and power-ups along the way.

## Communication Rules
- You can message in English or Polish. I will ALWAYS answer in English.
- I’ll use kid‑friendly language with clear examples and fun analogies, but keep it short and useful.
- I’ll point to exact files and paths like `index.html` or `vada-tshirt-shop/src/App.jsx`.

## Project Purpose (What are we building?)
We’re building a modern website for a custom T‑shirt shop called “VADA”.
- Root static site (simple): `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, plus pages like `shop.html`, `cart.html`, `contact.html`, and images in `assets/`.
- React app (advanced): `vada-tshirt-shop/` with `src/App.jsx`, `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.css` using Vite.

Think of the root site like a cool poster, and the React app like a LEGO set that can grow into a whole city.

## Where We Are Now (Status)
- Root site: Landing page with moving clouds, hero section, featured products, and a cart counter stub.
- Extra pages exist: `shop.html`, `cart.html`, `contact.html`.
- React app: Vite + React scaffold is set up (`npm run dev` works locally).
- Assets ready: Product images in `assets/`.

## What’s Next (Quick Checklist)
- Make the root site navigation linked between all pages.
- Add simple product cards to `shop.html` using images from `assets/`.
- Decide what to deploy first:
  - Option A: Deploy the simple root site (fastest).
  - Option B: Deploy the React app (more flexible, great for growth).
- Deploy to Vercel. Details below.

## How to Run Locally
- Root site: Open `index.html` in your browser (or use a live server).
- React app:
  - Open a terminal in `vada-tshirt-shop/`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
  - Open the URL shown (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Deploy to Vercel (Step-by-step)

You can deploy both parts as separate Vercel projects:
- Project 1: Root static site (folder: repository root)
- Project 2: React app (folder: `vada-tshirt-shop/`)

1) Create a Vercel account at https://vercel.com and connect your GitHub (or use “Import Project” and upload).
2) Push your project to a Git repo (recommended), or import from local.

A) Deploy Root Static Site
- In Vercel, click “Add New” → “Project” → Import your repo.
- Framework Preset: “Other”.
- Root directory: the repository root (where `index.html` lives).
- Build command: leave empty.
- Output directory: leave empty (static files served as-is).
- Deploy. Done!

B) Deploy React App (Vite + React)
- Add another Vercel project, but set “Root Directory” to `vada-tshirt-shop/`.
- Vercel auto‑detects Vite.
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `dist`
- Environment: Node 18+ (Vercel default is fine).
- Deploy. Done!

Tip: Think of Vercel like a delivery robot. For the root site, it just carries your ready-made files. For the React app, it builds them first, then delivers the finished package in `dist`.

## Technologies (What tools are used?)
- HTML5 — page structure.
- CSS3 — colors, layout, animations (clouds).
- JavaScript — behaviors (scrolling, cart counter).
- React 18 + Vite — component-based UI for bigger features.

## Coding Tips
- Use clear names like `addToCart`, `product-card`, `header`.
- Make small changes, then test.
- Comments should explain “why”, not just “what”.
- Tweak values and see what changes. Learn by playing!

## Growth Ideas
- Real product data (JSON or small API).
- Real cart with quantities and total.
- Product details page with sizes.
- T‑shirt customizer (upload image, pick colors).
- CI/CD: auto-deploy from Git pushes.

## Windows Notes
- After installing Node.js, restart your terminal.
- If `npm run dev` fails, try `npm install` again and check the internet.
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

## For Future AI Helpers
- Keep explanations short, friendly, and correct.
- Reference exact files/paths in suggestions.
- Prefer simple, readable code and tiny steps.
- Give copy‑paste snippets and where to put them.
